This project was designed to demonstrate how to create a simple recommender system using the MovieLens dataset. It covered importing necessary packages, loading and preprocessing data,
implementing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its weighted variant on the dataset, and evaluating the models' performance. 
Additionally, the lab explored advanced recommendation techniques using penalized Alternating Least Squares and the Funk SVD algorithm, concluding with enhanced model evaluations 
using the `scikit-surprise` package to achieve more accurate recommendations.
